## Introduction
Fetal health is critical for the well-being of both the mother and the child. This project utilizes a dataset containing various features related to fetal health to predict potential health issues. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a tool that aids in decision-making during prenatal check-ups.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `fetal_health.csv`, which includes various attributes related to fetal health. Key features include:
- Fetal heart rate
- Uterine contractions
- Fetal movement
- Other clinical indicators

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The environment used for executing Python code and documenting the process.
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
